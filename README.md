## A simple extension for translating titles in the catalogue on mangadex.org

This extension replaces the original titles in the DOM with the altTitles(names of the manga in other languages) from the api response that is used to populate the page. 

The replaced titles are highlighted with a different colour. In the extension settings you can change the color of the highlighthing, change the desired title language, and turn the extension ON and OFF.
